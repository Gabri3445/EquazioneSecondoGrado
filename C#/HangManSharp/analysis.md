The program fetches a random word from a pre determined list (words)
The user enters a word, the program checks each letter to see if it's there.
If it is in the right location highlight it green. 
If it is present in the word but not in the right place then highlight it yellow.
If it is not present highlight it red.
To the right of the screen show which letters have been already entered.
